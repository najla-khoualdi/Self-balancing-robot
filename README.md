# Self-balancing-robot
The project consists of a self-balancing robot with two wheels, it is based on the model of the inverted pendulum on a moving cart whose body can be modeled as an inverted pendulum and the cart corresponds to the wheels. this system relies on the principles of the balancing system to balance in an upright position.
 The goal of this project is to balance yourself in an upright position.
To do this, he must measure the angle of inclination and control the wheels until they reach a vertical position.
The two-wheeled balancing robot is an inverted pendulum problem.
